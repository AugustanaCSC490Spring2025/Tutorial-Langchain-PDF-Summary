# Tutorial-Langchain-PDF-Summary
This project is inspired by the CodeAcademy LangChain tutorial "Building a Language Model Application with LangChain: A Beginner's Guide", link: https://www.codecademy.com/article/building-a-language-model-application-with-langchain-a-beginners-guide.
We've made several significant improvements to the original tutorial:

Updated for current LangChain versions: The original code had several deprecated components that we've modernized
Claude AI integration: Replaced OpenAI with Claude 3 Haiku to eliminate the need for paid API usage
Enhanced error handling: Added robust error checking for better user experience
Streamlined architecture: Consolidated the application logic into a single, well-structured function
